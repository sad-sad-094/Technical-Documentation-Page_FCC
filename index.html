                <p>
                    The Python language has a substantial body of documentation, much of it 
                    contributed by various authors. The markup used for the Python documentation 
                    is <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>, 
                    developed by the <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io">docutils</a> 
                    project, amended by custom directives and using a toolset named 
                    <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx</a> to post-process 
                    the HTML output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This document describes the style guide for our documentation as well as the 
                    custom reStructuredText markup introduced by Sphinx to support Python 
                    documentation and how it should be used.

                <p>
                    The documentation in HTML, PDF or EPUB format is generated from text files 
                    written using the 
                    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/markup.html#markup">reStructuredText format</a>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Python’s documentation has long been considered to be good for a free programming 
                language. There are a number of reasons for this, the most important being the 
                early commitment of Python’s creator, Guido van Rossum, to providing documentation 
                on the language and its libraries, and the continuing involvement of the user community 
                in providing assistance for creating and maintaining documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The involvement of the community takes many forms, from authoring to bug reports 
                to just plain complaining when the documentation could be more complete or easier to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                This document is aimed at authors and potential authors of documentation for 
                Python. More specifically, it is for people contributing to the standard documentation 
                and developing additional documents using the same tools as the standard documents. 
                This guide will be less useful for authors using the Python documentation tools for 
                topics other than Python, and less useful still for authors not using the tools at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your interest is in contributing to the Python documentation, but you don’t 
                have the time or inclination to learn reStructuredText and the markup structures 
                documented here, there’s a welcoming place for you among the Python contributors as well. 
                Any time you feel that you can clarify existing documentation or provide documentation 
                that’s missing, the existing documentation team will gladly work with you to integrate 
                your text, dealing with the markup for you. Please don’t let the material in this document 
                stand between the documentation and your desire to help out!

                <h3>1.1. Use of Whitespace</h3>
                <p>
                    All reST files use an indentation of 3 spaces; no tabs are allowed. The 
                    maximum line length is 80 characters for normal text, but tables, deeply 
                    indented code samples and long links may extend beyond that. Code example 
                    bodies should use normal Python 4-space indentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make generous use of blank lines where applicable; they help group things together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A sentence-ending period may be followed by one or two spaces; while reST 
                    ignores the second space, it is customarily put in by some users, for 
                    example to aid Emacs’ auto-fill mode.

                <h3>1.2. Footnotes</h3>
                <p>
                    Footnotes are generally discouraged, though they may be used when they 
                    are the best way to present specific information. When a footnote reference 
                    is added at the end of the sentence, it should follow the sentence-ending 
                    punctuation. The reST markup should appear something like this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    This sentence has a footnote reference. [#]_ This is the next sentence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Footnotes should be gathered at the end of a file, or if the file is very 
                    long, at the end of a section. The docutils will automatically create 
                    backlinks to the footnote reference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Footnotes may appear in the middle of sentences where appropriate.

                    <p>
                        In the Python documentation, the use of sentence case in section 
                        titles is preferable, but consistency within a unit is more important 
                        than following this rule. If you add a section to a chapter where most 
                        sections are in title case, you can either convert all titles to sentence 
                        case or use the dominant style in the new section title.
                    </p>
                    <p class="example-section">
                        <strong>Sentence case:</strong> Sentence case is a set of capitalization 
                        rules used in English sentences: the first word is always capitalized 
                        and other words are only capitalized if there is a specific rule requiring it.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Sentences that start with a word for which specific rules require starting 
                    it with a lower case letter should be avoided.

                <p class="note-sections">
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Sections that describe a library module often have 
                    titles in the form of “modulename — Short description of the module”. 
                    In this case, the description should be capitalized as a stand-alone sentence.

                <p>
                    Many special names are used in the Python documentation, including the names 
                    of operating systems, programming languages, standards bodies, and the like. 
                    Most of these entities are not assigned any special markup, but the preferred 
                    spellings are given here to aid authors in maintaining the consistency of 
                    presentation in the Python documentation.

                <p>
                    The documentation focuses on affirmatively stating what the language does and 
                    how to use it effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Except for certain security or segfault risks, the docs should avoid wording 
                    along the lines of “feature x is dangerous” or “experts only”. These kinds 
                    of value judgments belong in external blogs and wikis, not in the core documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bad example (creating worry in the mind of a reader):

                    Warning: failing to explicitly close a file could result in lost data 
                    or excessive resource consumption. Never rely on reference counting to 
                    automatically close a file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Good example (establishing confident knowledge in the effective use of the language):

                <p class="tab-text">
                    A best practice for using files is use a try/finally pair to explicitly 
                    close a file after it is used. Alternatively, using a with-statement can achieve 
                    the same effect. This assures that files are flushed and file descriptor 
                    resources are released in a timely manner.

                <p>
                    More documentation is not necessarily better documentation. Err on the side of 
                    being succinct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is an unfortunate fact that making documentation longer can be an impediment 
                    to understanding and can result in even more ways to misread or misinterpret 
                    the text. Long descriptions full of corner cases and caveats can create the 
                    impression that a function is more complex or harder to use than it actually is.

            <section id="security-considerations" class="main-section">
                <h3>1.6. Security Considerations (and Other Concerns)</h3>
                <p>
                    Some modules provided with Python are inherently exposed to security 
                    issues (e.g. shell injection vulnerabilities) due to the purpose of the 
                    module (e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#module-ssl">ssl</a>). 
                    Littering the documentation of these modules with red warning boxes for 
                    problems that are due to the task at hand, rather than specifically to Python’s 
                    support for that task, doesn’t make for a good reading experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, these security concerns should be gathered into a dedicated 
                    “Security Considerations” section within the module’s documentation, 
                    and cross-referenced from the documentation of affected interfaces with a 
                    note similar to 
                    "Please refer to the :ref:`security-considerations` section 
                    for important information on how to avoid common mistakes.".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, if there is a common error that affects many interfaces 
                    in a module (e.g. OS level pipe buffers filling up and stalling child processes), 
                    these can be documented in a “Common Errors” section and cross-referenced 
                    rather than repeated for every affected interface.

                <p>
                    Short code examples can be a useful adjunct to understanding. Readers 
                    can often grasp a simple example more quickly than they can digest a 
                    formal description in prose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People learn faster with concrete, motivating examples that match the 
                    context of a typical use case. For instance, the 
                    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rpartition">str.rpartition()</a> 
                    method is better demonstrated with an example splitting the domain from 
                    a URL than it would be with an example of removing the last word from a line 
                    of Monty Python dialog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ellipsis for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.ps2">sys.ps2</a> 
                    secondary interpreter prompt should only be used sparingly, where it is 
                    necessary to clearly differentiate between input lines and output lines. 
                    Besides contributing visual clutter, it makes it difficult for readers to 
                    cut-and-paste examples so they can experiment with variations.

                <h3>1.8. Code Equivalents</h3>
                <p>
                    Giving pure Python code equivalents (or approximate equivalents) can be a 
                    useful adjunct to a prose description. A documenter should carefully weigh 
                    whether the code equivalent adds value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A good example is the code equivalent for

                    The short 4-line code equivalent is easily digested; it re-emphasizes the 
                    early-out behavior; and it clarifies the handling of the corner-case where 
                    the iterable is empty. In addition, it serves as a model for people wanting 
                    to implement a commonly requested alternative where all() would return the 
                    specific object evaluating to False whenever the function terminates early.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A more questionable example is the code for 
                    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby">itertools.groupby()</a>. 
                    Its code equivalent borders on being too complex to be a quick aid to 
                    understanding. Despite its complexity, the code equivalent was kept because 
                    it serves as a model to alternative implementations and because the operation 
                    of the “grouper” is more easily shown in code than in English prose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An example of when not to use a code equivalent is for the 
                    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#oct">oct()</a> 
                    function. The exact steps in converting a number to octal doesn’t add value 
                    for a user trying to learn what the function does.

                    The tone of the tutorial (and all the docs) needs to be respectful of 
                    the reader’s intelligence. Don’t presume that the readers are stupid. 
                    Lay out the relevant information, show motivating use cases, provide 
                    glossary links, and do your best to connect-the-dots, but don’t talk 
                    down to them or waste their time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tutorial is meant for newcomers, many of whom will be using the 
                    tutorial to evaluate the language as a whole. The experience needs to 
                    be positive and not leave the reader with worries that something bad will 
                    happen if they make a misstep. The tutorial serves as guide for intelligent 
                    and curious readers, saving details for the how-to guides and other sources.

                    Be careful accepting requests for documentation changes from the rare 
                    but vocal category of reader who is looking for vindication for one of 
                    their programming errors (“I made a mistake, therefore the docs must be 
                    wrong …”). Typically, the documentation wasn’t consulted until after the 
                    error was made. It is unfortunate, but typically no documentation edit would 
                    have saved the user from making false assumptions about the language 
                    (“I was surprised by …”).

                This section is a brief introduction to reStructuredText (reST) concepts and syntax,
                intended to provide authors with enough information to author documents productively. 
                Since reST was designed to be a simple, unobtrusive markup language, this will 
                not take too long.

                <h3>2.1. Paragraphs</h3>
                <p>
                    The paragraph is the most basic block in a reST document. Paragraphs are simply 
                    chunks of text separated by one or more blank lines. As in Python, indentation 
                    is significant in reST, so all lines of the same paragraph must be left-aligned 
                    to the same level of indentation.

                <h3>2.2. Inline Markup</h3>
                <p>
                    The standard reST inline markup is quite simple: use
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>one asterisk: *text* for emphasis (italics),</li>
                    <li>two asterisks: **text** for strong emphasis (boldface), and</li>
                    <li>backquotes: ``text`` for code samples.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If asterisks or backquotes appear in running text and could be confused 
                    with inline markup delimiters, they have to be escaped with a backslash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be aware of some restrictions of this markup:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>it may not be nested,</li>
                    <li>content may not start or end with whitespace: * text* is wrong,</li>
                    <li>
                        it must be separated from surrounding text by non-word characters. 
                        Use a backslash escaped space to work around that: thisis\ *one*\ word.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These restrictions may be lifted in future versions of the docutils.
                </p>
                <p>
                    reST also allows for custom “interpreted text roles”’, which signify that 
                    the enclosed text should be interpreted in a specific way. Sphinx uses 
                    this to provide semantic markup and cross-referencing of identifiers, as 
                    described in the appropriate section. The general syntax is :rolename:`content`.

            <section id="lists-quotes" class="main-section">
                <h3>2.3. Lists and Quotes</h3>
                <p>
                    List markup is natural: just place an asterisk at the start of a paragraph 
                    and indent properly. The same goes for numbered lists; they can also be 
                    automatically numbered using a # sign:
                </p>
                <p class="tab-text example-section">
                    * This is a bulleted list. <br>
                    * It has two items, the second item uses two lines. <br>
                    <br>
                    1. This is a numbered list. <br>
                    2. It has two items too. <br>
                    <br>
                    #. This is a numbered list. <br>
                    #. It has two items too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nested lists are possible, but be aware that they must be separated from 
                    the parent list items by blank lines:
                </p>
                <p class="tab-text example-section">
                    * this is <br>
                    * a list <br>
                    <br>
                    * with a nested list <br> 
                    * and some subitems <br>
                    <br>
                    * and here the parent list continues
                </p>
                <p>
                    Definition lists are created as follows:
                </p>
                <p class="tab-text example-section">
                    term (up to a line of text) <br>
                    &emsp; Definition of the term, which must be indented <br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp; and can even consist of multiple paragraphs <br>
                    <br>
                    next term <br>
                    &emsp; Description.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paragraphs are quoted by just indenting them more than the 
                    surrounding paragraphs.

                <p>
                    Literal code blocks are introduced by ending a paragraph with the special 
                    marker ::. The literal block must be indented:
                </p>
                <p class="tab-text example-section">
                    This is a normal text paragraph. The next paragraph is a code sample:: <br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp; It is not processed in any way, except <br>
                    &emsp; that the indentation is removed. <br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp; It can span multiple lines. <br>
                    <br>
                    This is a normal text paragraph again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The handling of the :: marker is smart:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If it occurs as a paragraph of its own, that paragraph is completely left 
                        out of the document.
                    </li>
                    <li>If it is preceded by whitespace, the marker is removed.</li>
                    <li>If it is preceded by non-whitespace, the marker is replaced by a single colon.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    That way, the second sentence in the above example’s first paragraph would be 
                    rendered as “The next paragraph is a code sample:”.

            <p>
                Section headers are created by underlining (and optionally overlining) the section 
                title with a punctuation character, at least as long as the text:

            <h2>2.7. Explicit Markup</h2>
            <p>
                “Explicit markup” is used in reST for most constructs that need special handling, 
                such as footnotes, specially-highlighted paragraphs, comments, and 
                generic directives.
            </p>
            <p>
                An explicit markup block begins with a line starting with .. followed by 
                whitespace and is terminated by the next paragraph at the same level of 
                indentation. (There needs to be a blank line between explicit markup and normal 
                paragraphs. This may all sound a bit complicated, but it is intuitive enough when 
                you write it.)

            <h2>2.8. Directives</h2>
            <p>
                A directive is a generic block of explicit markup. Besides roles, it is 
                one of the extension mechanisms of reST, and Sphinx makes heavy use of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Basically, a directive consists of a name, arguments, options and content. 
                (Keep this terminology in mind, it is used in the next chapter describing 
                custom directives.) Looking at this example,
            </p>
            <p class="tab-text example-section">
                .. function:: foo(x) <br>
                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; foo(y, z) <br>
                :bar: no <br>
                <br>
                Return a line of text input from the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                function is the directive name. It is given two arguments here, the 
                remainder of the first line and the second line, as well as one option 
                bar (as you can see, options are given in the lines immediately following the 
                arguments and indicated by the colons).
            </p>
            <p>
                The directive content follows after a blank line and is indented relative 
                to the directive start.

                There are some problems one commonly runs into while authoring reST documents:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Separation of inline markup:</strong> As said above, inline

                you have to use an escaped space to get around that.
            </p>
